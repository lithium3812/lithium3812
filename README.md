- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenichi!
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- I've worked as an intern for half a year at a company called delphai (or AtomLeap). It is a startup technology company that is providing AI SaaS for business intelligence. I was mainly responsible for data acquisition (scraping), data cleaning and engineering, data quality analysis and improvement, and also contributed to NLP tasks.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various topics necessary to be a data scientist, including statistical test, feature selection, and so on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of interesting projects involving machine learning.
